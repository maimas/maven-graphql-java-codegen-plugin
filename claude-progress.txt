Feature: #2 - Compile project and run all tests

COMPLETED:
1. Fixed compilation errors in SchemaFetcher.java
   - Removed @SneakyThrows annotation
   - Changed try-with-resources to explicit try-finally for CloseableHttpClient
   - Method now properly declares "throws IOException"

2. Removed Lombok @Data annotations from all model classes (12 files)
   - SchemaModel.java, Data.java, Schema.java, QueryType.java, MutationType.java
   - SubscriptionType.java, Type.java, Field.java, FieldType.java, Arg.java
   - EnumValue.java, Directive.java
   - Added explicit getters and setters to all classes

3. Fixed @SneakyThrows usage in UserConfig.java
   - Changed toString() method to use try-catch instead of @SneakyThrows

4. Fixed @SneakyThrows usage in TemplateProcessor.java
   - Changed generate() and getContext() methods to declare "throws Exception"
   - Changed getGQLBuildersContent() to declare "throws IOException"

5. Fixed test compilation errors
   - SchemaFetcherTest.java: Added "throws Exception" to test methods
   - TemplateProcessorTest.java: Added "throws Exception" to test_schema_generation()
   - GenerationIntegrationTest.java: Added "throws Exception" to test methods

6. Updated pom.xml
   - Added lombok.version property (1.18.36)
   - Removed explicit annotationProcessorPaths (not needed after Lombok removal from models)

BUILD STATUS:
- mvn clean compile: SUCCESS (20 source files compiled)
- mvn test-compile: SUCCESS (6 test source files compiled)
- Tests cannot be executed due to sandbox restrictions on Maven repository writes
  (surefire plugin requires downloading dependencies which fails)

VERIFICATION:
- All main source files compile successfully
- All test source files compile successfully
- Both main and test classes are present in target/ directory
