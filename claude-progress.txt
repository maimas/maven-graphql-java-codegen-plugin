Feature: #1 - Fix TemplateProcessorTest JSON normalization

COMPLETED:
- Modified GQLQuery.toString() in src/test/java/com/maimas/generated/GeneratedGraphqlAPI.java
  - Added .replace("\r\n", "\n") to normalize line endings to Unix-style
  - This ensures consistent JSON output across Windows, macOS, and Linux

- Updated src/test/java/com/maimas/processor/TemplateProcessorTest.java
  - Changed all test expectations from String.format() with %n to hardcoded \n
  - 5 test methods updated: testGeneratedMutationFunction_with_optional_arg_null,
    testGeneratedMutationFunction_with_optional_arg, testGeneratedMutationFunction_with_optional_ofNullable,
    testGeneratedMutationFunction_with_optional, testQueryBuilder

- Changes committed: 3050fbf

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
The issue was that Jackson's ObjectMapper.toPrettyString() always uses \n line endings,
but the tests used String.format() with %n which produces platform-specific line endings
(\r\n on Windows, \n on Unix). This caused test failures on Windows.

The fix normalizes the JSON output to always use \n, and the tests now expect \n consistently.

STATUS: Feature #1 implementation complete, tests should now pass on all platforms.
