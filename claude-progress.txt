Feature: #4 - Use Lombok for Getters and Setters in Model Classes - COMPLETED AND PASSING

PREVIOUS SESSION WORK (Sessions 1-2):
1. Fixed compilation errors in SchemaFetcher.java
2. Removed Lombok @Data annotations from all model classes (12 files) - added explicit getters/setters
3. Fixed @SneakyThrows usage in UserConfig.java and TemplateProcessor.java
4. Fixed test compilation errors in SchemaFetcherTest, TemplateProcessorTest, GenerationIntegrationTest
5. Removed Lombok 1.18.36 entirely (incompatible with Java 25)
6. Feature #1 (Compile project): PASSING
7. Feature #2 (Compile and run tests): PASSING

THIS SESSION WORK:
1. Re-added Lombok with version 1.18.40 (now compatible with Java 25)
   - Added lombok.version property (1.18.40) to pom.xml
   - Added Lombok dependency with scope=provided
   - Added annotationProcessorPaths to maven-compiler-plugin (required for JDK 23+)

2. Refactored all 12 model classes to use @Getter/@Setter annotations:
   - SchemaModel.java, Data.java, Schema.java, QueryType.java, MutationType.java
   - SubscriptionType.java, Type.java, Field.java, FieldType.java, Arg.java
   - EnumValue.java, Directive.java
   - Removed all explicit getter and setter methods
   - Preserved all @JsonProperty annotations on fields

3. Special handling for boolean 'isDeprecated' fields:
   - In Field.java and EnumValue.java, renamed field from 'isDeprecated' to 'deprecated'
   - Kept @JsonProperty("isDeprecated") to maintain Jackson deserialization compatibility
   - Lombok generates isDeprecated()/setDeprecated() for 'boolean deprecated' - matching original API

4. Fixed Schema.java: changed package-private fields 'types' and 'directives' to private

5. Verification:
   - mvn clean compile: SUCCESS
   - mvn test: SUCCESS - 18 tests run, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skipped (@Disabled)
   - All @JsonProperty annotations preserved (38 total across all model classes)
   - Feature #4 marked as PASSING

FEATURE PROGRESS:
- Feature #1 (Compile project): PASSING
- Feature #2 (Compile and run tests): PASSING
- Feature #4 (Lombok refactoring): PASSING
- Overall: 3/4 features passing (75%)

NOTES:
- Lombok 1.18.40 supports Java 25 (previous 1.18.36 did not)
- JDK 23+ requires explicit annotation processor configuration in maven-compiler-plugin
- Lombok Unsafe::objectFieldOffset warning is cosmetic, non-blocking
- Java version: 25.0.2 (Homebrew OpenJDK)
- Maven version: 3.9.12
