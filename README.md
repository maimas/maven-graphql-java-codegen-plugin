# GraphQL Java code generator Plugin
This is a maven plugin that generates TYPE SAFE java code from a remote GraphQL API,
so that you can have all the API methods and types in one generated source and easily build and execute query/mutations to the GQL server. 

It generates:
 - Types - object models including fields constants
 - InputObjects - graphql input objects schema
 - Queries - functions that takes arguments and output fields to build the GQL query or mutation. 

### Why this plugin exists?
Let's assume you have a java service that needs to call a remote GQL API to create a user `create(user: UserInput!): User`.
In order to create the user by calling GQL API, you need to know 3 things:
 1. `UserInput` object schema.
 2. `Output Field names` to be included in the result
 2. `Output object schema` - if you want to deserialize HTTP response body in to an User object.
 - This is how this mutation query string would look like:
 ````
query: {
    mutation create ($userInput: UserInput!) {
      create(user: $userInput) {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        enabled
        status
      }
    }
}

varaibles : {
  "userInput": {
    "email": "tet2.test@test.com",
    "password": "1234", 
  }
}
````
This is how you can build it with API generated by the plugin:
````
 UserInput userInput = new UserInput();
 userInput.email = "tet11.test@test.com";
 userInput.password = "1234";
       
 GQLQuery updateQuery = new Mutation().create(userInput,
       FragmentField.of(User.Fields.id), //an array of fields to be returned
       FragmentField.of(User.Fields.lastName),
       FragmentField.of(User.Fields.firstName),
       FragmentField.of(User.Fields.enabled),
       FragmentField.of(User.Fields.status));
````



### Prerequisites
- Java > 1.8

### Running the tests
Run ```mvn clean verify```

### Installing & Deployment
Once the code is ready for deployment run ``mvn deploy`` and it will upload the package to GitHug package registry.
Once jar package is deployed, you can add the dependency in to your project to use the models.
